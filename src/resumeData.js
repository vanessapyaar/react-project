    "aboutme":"I am currently a Frontend Dev and Designer at Boats Group. For the past 3 years, I have practiced my problem-solving skills, data analysis, design chops, and coding. I study and gather requirements to solve low engagement/low performance frontend problems with a user story in mind. My role is mixed and it keeps me challenged to never stop learning. I'm passionate about what I do but very detached from my outcomes, therefore I handle criticism as a normal part of any creative work. Professional yet friendly, I have an easy time walking through diversity and establishing connections. Making friends along the way is a plus that I am grateful for.",
